cs56-memory-card-game
=====================

This is a memory card game in which the player tries to match pairs of cards
based on their pictures.

The faster the player can match the cards, the higher their score will be.
Each time they make an incorrect match, they lose points.

The first level begins with a small grid, and each level that follows gets
increasing more difficult (the grid goes larger and larger).

At any point during the game, the player can click the reset button if they
would like to start over again.

At the end of the game, if the user has reached a new high score, they get
to enter their name into the leaderboard.



Instructions
============
## Launch the game on terminal with
```
ant run
```

After launching the game, you can choose one of three options:

### 1. Start the game
Allows the user to begin playing.

### 2. Instructions
Gives the user detailed instructions on how to play the game.

### 3. High Score
Lets the user view the current leaderboard, with the names and scores of the best players.

## Using Jacoco Testing via Maven by tying on terminal with
```
mvn package
```

Then, go to the "target/site/jacoco" directory and open "index.html". You will see the test coverage.

Developer Notes
===============

### Model
In Model directory, you will find all the java files that are related to data. 
According to the concept of "MVC", model only deals with data.
It stores all kinds of data for all the classes.
It will not change the view or change the data itself.

### View
In View directory, you will find all the java files that are related to GUI.
According to the concept of "MVC", view only present game structures to players.
All the classes in View are about changing the outlook.
It will not change the data itself.

### Controller
In Controller directory, you will find all the java files that call classes in View or Model.
Since View cannot change Model and vice versa, we need use Controller to help call the classes.
Controller acts like a brige that communicates with two sides, View and Model.
It can change the data and view.



project history
===============
### Yun Suk Chang worked on this in S13.  There were other authors before him.
### Xiaohe he and Shaoyi Zhang worked on this in W16.
### Annan Zhang and Shihua Lu worked on this in W18.
  - Refactor code into MVC
  - Replace sun.audio.* with javax.sound.sampled.* as sun.audio is deprecated
  - Add support to maven with test coverage
  - Fix the issue that multiple dialogs appear when user hits menu->reset
  - Fix the bug that instruction starts from the botttom instead of the top

# W18 Final Remarks:
We have refactored the code into MVC pattern, which we believe will help future students locate different issues.
Students should have a firm knowledge of MVC pattern so that they may find the structure of the code clear.
We tried to fix the bugs that are related to javax.swing.timer. However, it turned out that these bugs can be hard to fix.
Therefore, we suggest that students who want to start from easy issues should avoid working on these bugs first.

We also suggest future students consider making some fundamental changes to the game such as adding more features.

We believe that it is a good idea for future students to add more test cases to the project because when we took over this project, there were barely any junit tests. 
We have added some tests to the project but they are still far from full coverage.

Overall, this is a pretty interesting project and I hope future students will enjoy working on it.


# W16 Final Remarks:
We don't think this is a good project for students at any level of proficiency with Java.
The main reason is that this project is very well-built in terms of game logic and design.
For Java newbees, you won't be able to learn much about GUI, since the main structure is well-built.
For people who know Java from kindergartens, you might find this project boring.
We worried a lot about the "shrink" of points when we were working on this project.
Many issues we fixed are actually bugs instead of fundamental changes.
To fix a bug in a large project written by other undergraduate students is hard.
It might take hours to pinpoint a bug, but only write one line to fix the bug.

However, if you are brave and choose to work on this project:
We recomend you to start early and work on the issues created by Professor Conrad several years ago.
You will learn a lot from those issues. We didn't work on those good issues because we are distract by those "shrinking" issues.

# F16 Final Remarks:
We highly recommend that the next people who take on this project start by refactoring the code.
Although the code's structure isn't absolutely terrible, it could be improved drastically.
We think that it might be better if the overall structure of the project followed the
Model View Controller design pattern. This would make the project much easier to change in the future.

One of the largest problems with the current structure, if following MVC, is that MemoryGameGui.java is acting as
both the View and Controller. We believe it might be better if each menu display was separated into its own class, with
inheritance used as needed. We also believe it could be better if there was a Model for the current state of the game,
and a Model for all of the data that the game uses. And of course, a whole new Controller class must be created.

If there are a lot of classes that pertain to different parts of MVC, you can separate them into their own folders
(e.g. src/package/name/Model/ and src/package/name/View)

The timer is one of the more tricky things to work with in this project, and thus we believe that it should be made
into its own class entirely.

Refactoring would allow you to more easily fix issues #14, #15, and #16.
